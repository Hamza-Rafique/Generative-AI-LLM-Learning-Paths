## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive learning path for mastering **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It includes tutorials, articles, and practical projects focused on the concepts, architectures, and applications of generative models like **GPT**, **BERT**, and **DALL-E**. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner, this guide will help you understand the foundations and build real-world AI systems.

## Learning Path Outline

### 1. Introduction to Generative AI
- **What is Generative AI?**
  - Generative AI involves the creation of data (text, images, etc.) using AI models that understand and mimic human creativity.
  - Applications: Text generation, image synthesis, audio production, etc.
- **Key Generative Models**:
  - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Understanding adversarial training.
  - **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Learning probabilistic latent space representations.
  - **Transformers**: Exploring the architecture behind LLMs.
  - **Deep Learning Fundamentals**: Neural Networks, Backpropagation, Gradient Descent.

### 2. Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **What Are LLMs?**
  - Models like **GPT**, **BERT**, **T5**, and **ChatGPT** have transformed NLP by achieving human-like performance on various language tasks.
- **Core Concepts**:
  - **Transformers**: The architecture that powers modern LLMs.
  - **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on the most relevant parts of the input sequence.
  - **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into tokens for the model to process.
  - **Embeddings**: Converting text into a numerical format for machine learning models.
  
### 3. Training and Fine-tuning LLMs
- **Training LLMs from Scratch**:
  - How LLMs are trained on large corpora of text data.
  - Requirements: Computational resources, datasets, training frameworks.
- **Fine-tuning Pre-Trained Models**:
  - Fine-tune pre-trained models (e.g., **BERT**, **GPT-3**) for specific use cases like text classification, question answering, and sentiment analysis.
  - Transfer learning: Leveraging existing knowledge of a model on new tasks with limited data.
  
### 4. Advanced Topics in Generative AI & LLMs
- **Prompt Engineering**:
  - Crafting prompts to get the desired output from LLMs.
- **Zero-shot & Few-shot Learning**:
  - Using models without explicit retraining for new tasks.
- **Multimodal Models**:
  - Combining text, image, and audio models (e.g., **DALL-E**, **CLIP**).
- **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**:
  - Improving model accuracy with human feedback in real-time.
  
### 5. Building Projects with Generative AI & LLMs
- **Project 1: Building a GPT-based Chatbot**:
  - Fine-tune GPT models for creating a chatbot.
- **Project 2: Text Summarization using BERT**:
  - Fine-tuning **BERT** for generating concise summaries of long texts.
- **Project 3: Image Generation with DALL-E**:
  - Using **DALL-E** models for creating AI-generated images from text.

### 6. Tools & Libraries
